# The Udacity Self-driving Car Image Browser


Here is a readme file for a self driving yolo detection project hosted on Streamlit:

## Self Driving YOLO Detection Project

This project uses the YOLOv5 object detection model to detect objects in real time. The model is hosted on Streamlit, so it can be run in a web browser.

### To use the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the project:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

### The project will open in a web browser. You can then use the controls to detect objects in real time.

### The project uses the following libraries:

* YOLOv5
* Streamlit

### The project is still under development, but it can be used to detect a variety of objects, including cars, pedestrians, and cyclists.
